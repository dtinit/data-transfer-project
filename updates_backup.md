## Current State
<div class="mustache">
</div>
DTP is still in very active development, and while we have code that works for a variety of use cases, we are continually making improvements that might cause things to break occasionally. So as you are trying things please use it with caution and expect some hiccups. Both our bug list, as well as documentation in each provider’s directory are good places to look for known issues, or report problems you encounter.

## Project Updates
<div class="mustache">
</div>
We're excited about the progress we've made since we got this effort off the ground in July 2018.
  * Apple has officially joined the Project.
  * 18 contributors from a combination of partners and the open source community have inserted more than 42,000 lines of code and changed more than 1,500 files.
  * We've added framework features such as Cloud logging and monitoring to enable production use of the Data Transfer Project at companies developing new features.
  * We also updated integrations for new APIs from Google Photos and Smugmug that will enable users to move their photos between these services.
  * We have added new integrations for Deezer, Mastodon, and Solid.

The engineering work we’ve done through the Project has highlighted the importance of working with stakeholders to develop guidelines around portability.
