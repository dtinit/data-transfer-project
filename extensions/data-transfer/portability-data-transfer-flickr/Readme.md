# Flickr
This folder contains the extension implementation for the
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) service.

The implementation is based off of [Flickr4Java](https://github.com/boncey/Flickr4Java).

## Data Supported

 - [Photos](src/main/java/org/datatransferproject/datatransfer/flickr/photos) Import & Export

## Current State
No known issues, however like much of DTP still needs some in depth testing to ensure corner
cases are working.

## Keys & Auth

Apply for a key at [www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply)

Flickr uses OAuth 1.0 for authorization.

## Maintained By

The Flickr extension was created by the
[DTP maintainers](mailto:portability-maintainers@googlegroups.com)
and is not an official product of Flickr.
