# Facebook
This folder contains the extension implementation for
[Facebook](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/data-portability/).

## Data Supported
Facebook currently supports export of the following data types:

 - Photos
 - Videos
 - Social Posts <sup>1</sup>
 - Notes <sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Please contact the Facebook team at [dataportability@fb.com](mailto:dataportability@fb.com) if you are interested in developing with these data types.

## Current State

 - Photos and Videos export can be [run and tested locally](../../../Documentation/RunningLocally.md)
 - Social Posts and Notes are not yet available as open source, but are coming soon

## Development and Access 

Follow the [Developer Guide](../../../Documentation/Developer.md) for setting up your environment, and to find out how to get general support. 

### Create a Facebook app
Before getting started, you will need a [Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/apps), and you will need to request the required [permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference) as per the data type.

### Permissions

- Photos export - [user_photos](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_photos/)
- Videos export - [user_videos](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_videos/)
- Posts export - [user_posts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_posts/)
- Notes export - [user_posts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/user_posts/)

### Keys & Auth
Facebook uses OAuth 2 for authorization.

Under your Facebook app's Settings (Basic), you can find the _App ID_ and _App Secret_, which you can use as the OAuth `App Key` and `Secret` for authentication, as described in [Keys](../../../Documentation/Keys.md).
