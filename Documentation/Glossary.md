# UI Glossary

**Transfer a copy** : Short phrase describing the action of copying the data type and moving the copy to the destination. Transfer is a verb, copy is a noun. 
> **Usage note**: It’s phrased this way to be clear to people where their data lives, that the original data is staying on the service and that a copy is being transferred to the destination. If you’re moving the data off of the original service and it will only exist on the destination, then use transfer (verb) as a standalone term. Don’t use any of the verb forms of copy (ex: copying, copied) and instead use the verb form of transfer (ex: transferring, transferred).

**Destination** : The app or service provider that the person is transferring their data to. 
> **Usage note**: Destination is preferred over terms that describe the location, like “service” or “company” since it could easily get confused about which company or service is being referred to.

**Service** : Generic term that encompasses apps, websites and companies. 
> **Usage note**: If possible, name the service directly (ex: Google, Facebook, Twitter).

**Data / Information** : General terms that could describe many different types of people’s information. 
> **Usage note**: Whenever possible, describe the actual data or information type (ex: photos, videos, etc.).

**Sign into / Signed into**: Labels describing the destination service that has been authenticated to transfer data to.
>	**Usage note**: “Signed into” is preferred over “connected to” since it confirms that the sign in (or authentication) process to the other service has been done successfully. It’s also has more of a temporal feel and doesn’t give the impression that the person has connected the two accounts forever. The UI for removing the destination account is “sign out.”
