# Integration Guide

This guide covers the following options for integrating your service, with the primary use case being the integration of a new transfer service.

* [Integrate a new transfer service](#integrate-a-new-transfer-service)
* [Integrate a new data model](#integrate-a-new-data-model)
* [Integrate a new cloud provider](#integrate-a-new-cloud-provider)

## Integrate a new transfer service
A new service can be integrated into the Data Transfer Project by creating the following extensions:

1. Transfer Extension
1. Auth Extension
1. Optionally, a new Data Model may be required if your does not exist. Please see Integrate a new Data Model (below) for more information.

### Transfer Extension

Transfer Extensions are located in the [extensions/data-transfer module](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/tree/master/extensions/data-transfer), where they are organized by service provider and then by data type.

1. Create a new directory for your provider under extensions/data-transfer

  `$mkdir extensions/data-transfer/portability-data-transfer-foo`

2. Create a build.gradle file in your new directory

  `$touch extensions/data-transfer/portability-data-transfer-foo/build.gradle`

3. Add the spi and cloud dependencies to your build file along with any sdk or related dependencies specific to your code

  * Common dependencies include logging, see example below

  dependencies {
      compile project(':portability-spi-cloud')
      compile project(':portability-spi-transfer')
      
     // logging
      compile("org.slf4j:slf4j-api:${slf4jVersion}")
      compile("org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12:${slf4jVersion}")
     
      compile(YOUR DEPS HERE)
      }
  ```
  
4. Add an entry for your extension in root settings.gradle
``` javascript
// Foo transfer extension
include ':extensions:data-transfer:portability-data-transfer-foo'
```

5. Create the META-INF file

  `$touch extensions/data-transfer/portability-data-transfer-foo/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.dataportabilityproject.spi.transfer.extension.TransferExtension`

6. Create the directory for your main code

 `$mkdir -p extensions/data-transfer/portability-data-transfer-foo/src/main/java/org/dataportabilityproject/transfer/foo/`

7. Create FooTransferExtension extending TransferExtension

  * See class javadoc for [TransferExtension](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/master/portability-spi-transfer/src/main/java/org/datatransferproject/spi/transfer/extension/TransferExtension.java) for full documentation

  * Best practices:

    * Validate the TransferExtension isn’t initialized more than once in a running binary
    * Most providers will interact with their api via a ‘registered’ app providing a client id/key and secret. Those will be stored in a key management system and retrieved via an identifier for the key and one for the secret,
    * In initialize, retrieve the AppCredentialStore
    * Return an Exporter and Importer for a given transfer type and mode

8. Create FooTransferExtensionTest
  * TODO: add more

### Auth Extension

Auth Extensions are located in the [extensions/auth module](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/tree/master/extensions/auth), where they are organized by service provider

1. See class javadoc for the [AuthServiceExtension](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/blob/master/portability-spi-api/src/main/java/org/datatransferproject/spi/api/auth/extension/AuthServiceExtension.java) for full documentation
  * This class should... (TODO: add more content)
  * Best practices:

    * Most providers will interact with their api via a ‘registered’ app providing a client id/key and secret. Those will be stored in a key management system and retrieved via an identifier for the key and one for the secret,

    * Return an FooAuthDataGenerator for a given transfer type and mode

2. Create an FooAuthDataGenerator implementing AuthDataGenerator

3. Create the test directory for the FooAuthDataGeneratorTest

  * `$mkdir -p extensions/auth/portability-auth-instagram/src/test/java/org/datatransferproject/auth/foo`

4. Create FooAuthDataGeneratorTest with appropriate tests



## Integrate a new Data Model

* The shared model classes for supported Transfer Data Types are located in the [portability-types-transfer](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/tree/master/portability-types-transfer) module

* The first thing to do is look for any existing model classes that may support your use case or that can be extended to support your use case
