## First Run/Setup

###  From top level directory
* Install Git: `sudo apt-get install git-all`
* Install Gradle: `sudo apt-get install gradle`
 * Install NVM: `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash`
 * Install Node: `nvm install node`
 * Install Angular: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
 * [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
 * Install the Angular CLI `./gradlew client:installLocalAngularCli`

## IntelliJ setup
The following instructions work for IntelliJ IDEA version 2017.2.6.

#### Import the project
 * Open IntelliJ -> Import Project
 * Navigate to the 'data-transfer-project' directory where you have git cloned the repo
 * Import project from external model (Gradle) -> uncheck 'Create separate module per source set' -> Finish

#### Enable annotation processing
 * Go to File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors
 * Check 'Enable annotation processing'
 * Store generated sources relative to: 'Module content root' (not the default)
 * Production sources directory: `build/classes/java/`

#### Setup formatting
* File -> Settings -> Editor -> General -> Ensure line feed at file end on Save
* Install the 'google-java-format' plugin, and enable it in Settings

#### Setup automatic license header
* Go to File -> Settings -> Editor -> Copyright -> Copyright Profiles
* Click the green + button, add a new profile called "Data-Transfer-Project-Authors". Use this as the text:

```
Copyright $today.year The Data Transfer Project Authors.

```
* Create a new temp file (e.g. Test.java) in Intellij.
* Inside the file, enter Alt-Insert -> Copyright
* It should prompt you to select the new Copyright profile
* The copyright should be added to all new files from now on (note: it might be collapsed so not immediately obvious)

## Creating the Docker Network
You only need to do this once.  The network will remain created even if you stop Docker.
* `sudo service docker start`
* `docker network create dataportability`

## Building/Running the API server and worker locally
The following builds and optionally runs the demo server (containing the API and Transfer Worker)
on `port:8080`

 * NOTE: The first time you run you need to configure your credentials by copying
   distributions/common/dataportability.secrets.example.properties to
   .gradle/dataportability.secrets.properties and inserting the API keys and secrets for
   the services you with to interact with.

 * `./gradlew :distributions:demo-server:dockerize`
   * This copies over LOCAL secrets and settings (configured in .gradle/properties.gradle) using
   the LocalCloud implementation
   * This will also build the docker image.

 * ` docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 5005:5005 --name demoserver --network dataportability dataportability/demoserver`
   * This will run the demo server image that was just created on localhost:8080
   * To test that this works as expected, visit https://localhost:8080/_/listDataTypes

## Building/Running the Web Application locally
The following builds and optionally runs the web application. Before running the web application,
make sure you have started the demoserver locally (step above) on the docker network that you created.

 * `./gradlew -PcloudType=local :distributions:demo-server:dockerize`
   <!-- TODO: the docker image creation for the webapp should be split out into the :client module -->
   * In addition to creating the Docker image for the Demoserver, this also creates the web
   application docker image
 * `docker run --rm -p 3000:443 --name client --network dataportability dataportability/client`
   * This will run the web application locally on the dataportability docker network.
   * You should now be able to access the web application at https://localhost:3000

## Deploying in production

A demo distribution for Google Cloud Platform is available at
`distributions/demo-google-deployment`.

A demo Azure distribution is also in development.

## Build Problem F.A.Q

### AutoValue errors
If you get an error `error: duplicate class... final class AutoValue_...` it is indicative of your IDE and gradle clashing.  To fix it you want to delete the referenced build/classes directory.
