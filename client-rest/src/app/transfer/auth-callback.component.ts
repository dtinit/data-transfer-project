/**
 * Receives callbacks from external OAuth export and import services. Updates the application state with corresponding OAuth tokens.
 *
 * Authentication is handled in several steps:
 *
 * 1. After receiving the callback and token (code) from the export OAuth service, this component requests the API server to generate export auth data, which it stores as part
 *    of application state.
 *
 * 2. Import auth configuration is generated and the browser is redirected to the import OAuth service.
 *
 * 3. After the user has authenticated, the import OAuth service will redirect the browser back to this compenent, passing the import auth token (code).
 *
 * 4. This component requests the API server to generate import auth data, which it stores as part of application state.
 *
 * 5. The transfer process is continued.
