# Script to encrypt application secrets, and then upload the encrypted secrets as well as the (raw)
# app keys to GCS.
#
# Usage: ./encrypt_and_upload_secrets.sh <PATH_TO_SECRETS_FILES>
#
# Ensure the correct project id is sets in your gcloud config, to see the current one, use:
#    gcloud config get-value project
#
# Ensure app-data-<project-id> bucket exists in the project <project id>
#
# This script expects the following structure to be found at the path provided
# <PATH_TO_SECRETS_FILES>/raw_secrets/
# <PATH_TO_SECRETS_FILES>/keys/
# <PATH_TO_SECRETS_FILES>/encrypted_secrets/
#
# Example:
# The following should exist:
#   /tmp/keys/FLICKR_KEY.txt
#   /tmp/raw_secrets/FLICKR_SECRET.txt
#   /tmp/encrypted_secrets/ #empty
#
# The gcloud project id should be set
#   gcloud config set project my-gcp-project
#
# Then running ./encrypt_and_upload_secrets.sh tmp
# will create:
#   /tmp/encrypted_secrets/FLICKR_SECRET.encrypted
#
# and upload them to the project my-gcp-project at
#   app-data-my-gcp-project/keys/FLICKR_KEY.txt
#   app-data-my-gcp-project/encrypted_secrets/FLICKR_SECRET.encrypted
#
