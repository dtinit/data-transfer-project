If you want a plain website without all of this
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)/[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
business, you just need to fill the repository with plain html and css
and avoid directory names that start with underscores.

If you want some directories with underscores, just include a file
named `.nojekyll`. You might just include that anyway.  See the
[source for my kbroman.github.io](https://github.com/kbroman/kbroman.github.io)
site.

I recommend using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
though. Markdown is just so much nicer than html, to write and
maintain.

Now go to [testing your site locally](local_test.html).
