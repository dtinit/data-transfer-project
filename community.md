## How to participate
<div class="mustache">
</div>

We welcome everyone to participate, the more expertise and viewpoints we have contributing to the project the more successful it will be. There are four ways to join the Data Transfer Project:
  * **Partner** - To become a partner in the Data Transfer Project, an organization must agree to follow the principles and best practices described in the DTP white paper, contribute to DTP efforts, and participate in the DTP by committing to add and maintain adapters. These organizations have their logos on the DTP website and represent the project publiclyin public conversations.
  * **Provider** - A provider is an organization integrated into the project, either because it developed its own adapter or had a public API another developer integrated with the project. Data can move into and out of these organizations subject to the terms of the provider APIs.
  * **Contributor** - As an open source project, anyone can contribute to the code repository comprising the DTP codebase.
  * **Thought leadership** - The Data Transfer Project meets regularly with thought leaders, other interested members of the public, and the  research community. Anyone can join the mailing list at (DTP Discuss) and (Slack Channel) to stay informed of developments and discussions.

## What providers may participate in the Data Transfer Project?
<div class="mustache">
</div>

The DTP facilitates the transfer of an individual’s data between providers. For a provider to be included in the Project, they have to provide export (and ideally import) functionality for some or all of their users’ data. \*(If the organization is a Partner, they should plan to build import functionality due to the principle of reciprocity.) Functionality may be executed through a public-facing API or other reasonable substitute. Code for some providers may have been included in the repository via contributions to the developer community, who can utilize public-facing APIs to build an adapter.
