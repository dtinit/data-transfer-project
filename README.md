## Overview
Data Transfer Project (DTP) is a collaboration of organizations committed to making data
portability easier and more usefull.

DTP is a common framework of open-source code that can connect any two online service
providers, enabling a seamless, direct transfer of data between the two platforms.

DTP uses existing APIs and Authorization method provided by services and through a
series of service specific adapters converts the data in between formats. 
DTP also provides the infrastructure to power these data transfers in a secure,
scalable, and reliable way.
