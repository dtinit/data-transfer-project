# Data Transfer Project

## Overview
The Data Transfer Project makes it easy for users to transfer their data between online services. We provide a common framework and ecosystem to accept contributions from service providers to enable seamless transfer of data into and out of their service.

## Who We Are
Data Transfer Project (DTP) is a collaboration of organizations committed to building a common framework with open-source code that can connect any two online service providers, enabling a seamless, direct transfer of data between the two platforms.

We want all individuals across the web to be in control of their data.

## Current State
Data Transfer Project is in its early stages, and we are actively looking for partner organizations and individuals to contribute to the project. We are continuing to define the architecture and implementation.  Since the code is in active development, please do thorough testing and verification before implementing.

## About Us
The Data Transfer Project was formed in 2017 to create an open-source, service-to-service portability platform so that all individuals across the web could easily move their data between online service providers.

The partners in the Data Transfer Project believe portability and interoperability are central to innovation. Making it easier for individuals to choose among services facilitates competition, empowers individuals to try new services and enables them to choose the offering that best suits their needs.

We anticipate the Data Transfer Project solution will make a particularly big impact in global markets where downloading or uploading data is expensive and/or slow. The Data Transfer Project eliminates the need to download data at all. Instead, files are transferred directly between service providers.
