# Interactive script to build a Docker image for the given binary and environment.
# Can optionally build a new jar, build a new docker image, and upload it to GCP based on the
# command prompts.
#
# Usage: ./config/gcp/build_and_upload_docker_image.sh <binary> <env> [project-suffix]
# - binary is required and specifies which server to build.
#     This should be one of: api, worker
#     ex: api will build the portability-api binary
# - env is the environment you would like to build in. This should correspond to an environment dir
#     in config/environments. Settings for this environment are copied into the binary.
# - project-suffix is required except for env=local
#
# Must be run from the root source directory data-portability/
#
# ex: build_and_upload_docker_image.sh api qa qa2
# Will package and deploy portability-api using config/environments/qa/settings.yaml and
# project BASE_PROJECT_ID-qa2
#
