# portability-spi-transfer

This folder contains the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for DTP's
transfer abstractions.

If you are [adding a new service provider integration](../Documentation/Integration.md) 
these are the interfaces needed.

See our [current integrations](../extensions/data-transfer) for example of implementation of
these interfaces.
