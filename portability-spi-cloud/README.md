# portability-spi-cloud

This folder contains the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for DTP's
Cloud abstractions.

DTP is designed to be runnable from any cloud infrastructure, or locally.

This folder contains the SPIs needed from any cloud implementation.

[Current cloud implementations](../extensions/cloud).

If you want to add support for a new cloud platform, simply add
implementations of these interfaces to a new project in the above folder.
